"In A Vision and related textual fragments composed  between 1919 and 1925,  hyperstitional  agents Michael  Robartes and Owen Aherne recount the discovery  of an arcane philosophical system encoded  in a series of geomet- rical diagrams—‘squares and spheres,  cones  made up  of  revolving  gyres",,,,,,,
"intersecting  each  other at various  angles, figures sometimes  with  great complexity’ found accidentally by Robartes in a book that had been propping up the lopsided furniture of his  shady Cracow  bedsit.2   Aherne is  skeptical,  but as Robartes delves further into the system’s origin, he discovers that the Cracow book (the Speculum Angelorum et Hominis by one ‘Giraldus’, published in 1594) recapitulates the belief system of ",,,,,,,
"an Arabian sect known  as  the  Judwalis  or  ‘diagrammatists’,",,,,,,,
"long lost—containing the teachings of Kusta ben Luka, a philosopher at the ancient Court of Harun Al-Raschid,  although  rumour has  it  that ben  Luka got it from a desert djinn.3",,"A nice long list of passages of the cryptography key, from fiction books, to fiction stories, to here to the ccru","3. The Yeats’s otherworldly interlocutors initially instructed that the origin of the diagrams remain secret,  although Robartes  is allowed to speculate on the  system’s provenance  in the  intro- duction to the 1925 edition of A Vision: ‘The Judwali had once possessed a learned book…attributed  to a certain  Kusta ben Luka, Christian Philosopher at the Court of Harun Al-Raschid, and though  this, and a smaller book describing the  personal life of the  philosopher, had  been  lost or destroyed  in desert fighting some  generations  before  his time, its doctrines  were remembered, for they had always constituted the beliefs of the Judwalis who look upon Kusta ben Luka as their founder.  […] I  am convinced,  however,  that this doctrine  did not originate with Kusta ben Luka, for certain terms and forms of expression suggest  some remote Syriac origin. I once told an old Judwali of my conviction upon this point but he merely said that Kusta ben Luka had doubtless been taught by the desert  djinns who lived to a great age and remembered ancient languages.’ (More on this later.) Ibid., lx–lxi. On Harun Al-Raschid, see al-Tabari, The History of al-Tabari, Vol. XXX ‘The Abbasid Caliphate in Equilib- rium’, tr. C.E. Bosworth (Albany, SUNY, 1989).",,,,
The hypothesis that a copy of Giraldus’s book was among  those  texts  seized  by  the  University  of Warwick when  it  ejected the Cybernetic  Culture Research  Unit (Ccru)  from the custodianship of its philosophy department in 1997 is unsupported by anything other than dim intimations and local hearsay;,,,,,,,
"however, it can be asserted with some level of confidence that members  of the unit had been in possession of fragments of Yeats’s record of Robartes’s discovery, if not the full text of A Vision in either of its two predominant  instantiations.

"Indeed,  a diligent student of occulted spironomics might even draw the timeline back to 1992 where the gyre emerges  as the infamous ‘fanged noumenon’ of the eponymous  chapter in  Land’s  bizarre  monograph, The Thirst for Annihilation.5",,"5.

"Giraldus’s diagrams are all variations on a principle schema of two intersecting cones, one inverted and nested inside the other:6",,"6. Yeats, ‘The Second Coming’, 32.",,,,,
"As in Robartes’s historical account of the system’s exposition by four dancers (pupils of Kusta ben Luka) in the desert sands before a doubtful caliph, the full implications of the schema  are not apparent until it is set in motion, ",,,,,,,
for each cone must be imagined to house a double gyre which simultaneously expands and contracts in opposite directions and in rhythmic alliance with the gyres of the opposing cone.7   The range of these expansions and contractions denotes relative increases and decreases in the influence of the four faculties attributed to each  of the turning gyres. ,,A machine made to come alive by the function of dance. A diagram activated.,"7. Yeats,  ‘The Dance  of the  Four Royal Persons’,  in A Vision
[1925], 10–12.",,,,
"In this manner, the values represented by the schema are always in steady relation, ‘the energy of one tendency being in  exact mathematical proportion to that of the other’: a waxing here corresponds to a waning there.8 ",,"This is a response to the Meillassouxian issue of the Real supercedeing all, and all the extra anglo fetish of the Real. It says something like the diagrams given to the symbolic are unactivated, we've had no sense of their true activation other than further diagrammatization, but that we now enter into an age where clues of motion of those diagrams are revealed, such that we do not throw out the diagrams , and acknowledge it is not all language, but something machinic, numeric in motion that activates communication.","8. Ibid., 106.",,,,
"When a cone has exhausted one full  sequence of  its  double  gyre,  a  sudden  transfer of momentum compels a shift  from that cone to its  counterpart across  their extremities  (a jump from the narrow end of Cone A to the dilated end of Cone B, and vice versa).",,,,,,,
" Because of this dynamic, one cone  is  always in  prominence  while  the other is  occulted,  an  arrangement that reverses  at the conclusion  of  the next gyre  sequence, or  ‘cycle’.",,,,,,,
"This  jump  corresponds to one of the four ‘phases of crisis’ and indexes an epistemological blind spot comparable to the event horizon of a black hole, impossible  to see  beyond  from a point  internal  to the system.",,"Epistemological blind spot is Amy's way of saying, incomputable, non diagrammable, non formalizable, non statistically modelable",,,,,
"Grasped  from outside, however,  the strange hydraulics of the gyres describe a fatalistic set of inversions and returns that ultimately furnish a rich resource  for augury, one that Yeats, editing Robartes’s  papers,  unhesitatingly  exploited  in  the first version of A Vision.9",,"augury= predicition of future

9. Of the 28 Phases, there are four Phases of Crisis (1, 8, 15, 22) and 24 intermediary Phases  which can be grouped  into triads to yield the  structure of 12 divisions (or gyres)  that comprise one great cycle. Although much more could detail be given here, I am deliberately restricting  this account to the hydraulics and the  historical predictions of the  system.  For a good summary see R. Ryan, ‘The Is and the Ought, the Knower and Known: An
Analysis of the Four Faculties in Yeats’ System’, in N. Mann, M. Gibson, and C. Nally (eds),  W. B. Yeats’ ‘A Vision’:  Explications and Contexts (Clemson University, 2012).",This quartet schema is ofcourse a group of machines whose operations are fatalistically binary and are thus teleologically doomed to fractal ontology,,,,
"When applied to the task of historical divination (our interest here),  the waxing and waning of the gyres can  be  charted in  twenty-eight phases  along the path of an expanding and contracting meta-gyre or ‘Cycle’ which endures  for roughly two millennia and is neatly divisible into twelve sub-gyres  (comprising four cardinal phases and eight triads) each of which denotes a single twist in the larger, container Cycle.10",,"10. This meta-gyre or ‘Cycle’  could also usefully be  termed
‘Aeon’. The system is much more complex than this, but further enumerations  must be left for a future study.",,,,,
"According to the system as it was originally relayed to George Yeats through the automatic script (an exact date does not appear in the Speculum Angelorum et Hominis  or Judwali  teachings),  the twelfth gyre in our current—waxing—Cycle  turns in  2050,  when ‘society as mechanical force  [shall] be complete at last’ and humanity, symbolized by the figure of The Fool,",,,,,,,
" ‘is but a straw blown by the wind, with no mind but the wind and no act but a nameless drifting and turning’, before  the first decade  of the twenty-sec- ond century (a ‘phase of crisis’) ushers in an entirely new set of twelve gyres: the fourth Cycle and the first  major  historical  phase  shift  in  two thousand years.11   ",,"11. Yeats, A Vision [1925], 176; 93. Compare Yeats’s illustration of The Fool at the  end of this Cycle—the  tarot sequence is inverted—as ‘but a straw blown by the wind, with no mind but the  wind’ with the  epigraph  (from  Bataille)  of ‘Fanged  Nou- menon’ in Land’s book: ‘what matters is not the enunciation of the wind, but the wind’. G. Bataille, Œuvres  Complètes, Vol. V, ed. V. Leduc (Paris: Gallimard, 1973), 25; Land, The Thirst for Annihilation, 105.",,,,,
"Laying  Yeats’s  awkward  predictions  (which he himself shelved for the 1937 edition of A Vision) to one  side, the system provides  material  for the inference  of several telling  traits that can be com- bined to give a rough sketch of this imminent Cycle upon whose cusp we uneasily reside.",,,,,,,
"Unlike the ‘primary’  religious  era  that has  preceded it—marked by dogmatism, a drive towards unity, verticality, the need  for transcendent regulation,  and the symbol of the sun—",,,,,,,
"the coming  age  will  be lunar,  secular, horizontal,  multiple,  and immanent:  an ‘antithetical multiform influx’.12  ",,"12. Yeats, A Vision [1937], 301.",,,,,
"The ‘rough beast’ of ‘The Second Coming’,   Christ’s   inverted   double,  sphinx-like   (a creature of the threshold) with  a ‘gaze  blank  and pitiless  as the sun’,  will  bear  the age  forward  into whatever twisted future the gyres have marked out for it.13",,"13. Yeats, ‘The Second  Coming’. It is not insignificant  to note here that the Sphinx has two reported  riddles, one invoking lin- ear time and the other invoking cyclical time.",,,,,
"In ‘Teleoplexy’, as the most recent, succinct expression  of accelerationism  in  its  Landian  form (distinguished  from the Left  queering  of the term more frequently  associated  with  Srnicek  and  Williams’s ‘Manifesto  for  an  Accelerationist  Politics’),14  ",,"14. N. Srnicek and A. Williams, ‘#Accelerate: Manifesto  for an Accelerationist Politics’, in Mackay and Avanessian (eds),  #Ac- celerate.  It should be noted that the models of modernity mar- shalled by ‘Left’  and  ‘Unconditional’ accelerationism  differ in several key respects, leading to an ultimate divergence  in their attitudes towards the  possibility of politics. This essay  deals specifically with the nexus of (chiefly) Landian ideas that have recently been brought together under the title of ‘Unconditional Accelerationism’. See, for example, V. Garton, ‘Accelerationism without Conditions’, <https://vincentgarton.com/2017/03/08/ acceleration-without-conditions/>.",,,,,
"  Land draws  out the latent  cybernetic structure  of  the Judwalis’  system and employs  it  to reach  a similar catastrophic  prediction,   although   the  somewhat restrained  invocation  of  ‘Techonomic  Singularity’ dampens   the rush  of  what  has  previously  been designated as  ‘a  racing  non-linear  countdown to planetary switch’ in which ‘[z]aibatsus flip into sentience as the market melts to automatism, politics is  cryogenized  and  dumped  into  the liquid-helium meat-store, drugs  migrate  onto neurosoft viruses and immunity is grated-open against jagged reefs of feral AI explosion, Kali culture, digital dance-depend- ency, black shamanism epidemic, and schizophrenic break-outs from the bin’.15",,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaibatsu,"15. Land, ‘Circuitries’, 317; Land, ‘Machinic Desire’, 344.",,,,
"  Like the Judwalis’ system, the medium of accelerationism is time, ",,"But what else could it be? Couldn't acceleration function on the blockchain as non time dependent? Or even more strangely, computation can easily shuffle the past, but to find future solutions (optimized solutions) is computatiaonlly complex. This makes it so that Optimization (Diagonalization drift) follows after the machinic singularity",,,,,
"and the message here regarding temporality is consistent: not a circle  or a line;  not 0, not 1—but  the torsional  assemblage arising from their convergence, precisely what ‘breaks  out from the bin[ary]’.  ",,Yes. but exit is doubled. The first break from the bin[ary] is the landing into the machinic singularity followed by the second AI explosion.,,,,,
"Both systems, as maps of modernity, appear as, and are piloted by, the spiral (or ‘gyre’). As an unidentified carrier once put it, ‘the diagram comes first’.16",,"16. N.

"According to its own propaganda,  modernity is progressive,  innovative,  irreversible,  and expansive.17 ",,"17. Land, ‘Cybergothic’, 351; N. Land, Shanghai Times (Urbanat- omy Electronic, 2013).",,,,,
"It plots a direct line out of the cyclical, seasonal pulse of pre-modern  ecology to a future state of technical mastery and  social  enlightenment. ",,,,,,,
"The  modernist imperative  to ‘make  it  new’  ostensibly  refuses  the closure  and insulation  against shock  expressed  by cyclicality, yet, as Land is quick to point out, subsequently smuggles it back in by other means, championing  self-referentiality  in  modernist  aesthetics, relying on the cycle as the basic unit for historical and  economic analysis,  retaining  archaic  calendric arrangements, and betraying  its  prevalence  in  the popular imagination via the emergence of the time loop as a key archetypal trope in twentieth-century science fiction.18 ",,"18. Interestingly enough, Ezra Pound’s famous line was filched from China: ‘The source  is a historical anecdote  concerning Ch’eng T’ang, first king of the Shang dynasty (1766–1753 BC), who was said to have had a washbasin inscribed with this inspi- rational slogan.’ M. North, Novelty: A History of the New (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press,  2013), 162; N. Land, Tem- plexity: Disordered Loops Through Shanghai Time (Urbanatomy Electronic, 2014), §7.8.",,,,,
A link between the cyclic inclination and anthropomorphic bias can easily be excavated by pointing to the myriad cyclic rhythms intrinsic to the natural  human  physiology  that surreptitiously conditions  modernity’s  self-apprehension  from the inside.,,,,,,,
"This disavowed duplicity at the heart of the modernist enterprise exposes the falseness of its relation to the ‘new’ by revealing the extent to which it always hedges  its bets against radical openness,  or what Land will call the Outside. ",,,,,,,
Modernity’s novelty only arrives via a restricted economy of possibility,,,,,,,
for which the terms (commensurate with human affordability) are always set in advance.19,,"19. Land has criticized this before:  ‘[Modernity] lives in a pro- found and uneasy relation to an outside that both attracts and repels it, a relation that it precariously resolves within itself from a position of unilateral mastery. The paradox of enlightenment, then, is an attempt to fix a stable relation with what is radically other, since insofar as the other is rigidly positioned within a re- lation it is no longer fully other. If before encountering otherness we already know what its relation to us will be, we have obliter- ated it in advance.’ N. Land, ‘Kant, Capital and the Prohibition of Incest’, Fanged Noumena, 55–80:  64.",,,,,
"Posed  as  an  epistemological  question,  the fortifications  erected by  this  arrangement  against the intrusion  of the unprecedented and  unknown  are highly  suspicious.  ",,,,,,,
"What  Landian  accelerationism shares   with  the Judwalis’  system  is  an  acknowl- edgement that the real shape of novelty is not linear but Land’s cybernetic upgrade of the gyre reads  the spiral  as a cipher  for positive  feedback  and,  charged  with  the task of diagramming modernity,  locates  its  principal  motor in  the escalatory  M-C-M’  circuitry  of capitalism.  ",,,,,,,
"Against  the metrical models of feedback  expounded by Norbert Weiner, ",,,,,,,
"whose  foundational Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine operates  as   ‘propaganda   against  positive   feed- back—quantizing it as amplification within an invar- iable metric—[to establish] a cybernetics of stability fortified against the future’,",,Weiner against unrestricted growth,,,,,

"[I]t is necessary  to differentiate not just between negative  and  positive  feedback  loops,  but be- tween stabilization circuits, short-range runaway circuits,  and  long-range  runaway  circuits.  By conflating the two latter, modernist cybernetics has  trivialized  escalation  processes into  unsus- tainable  episodes  of quantitative  inflation,  thus",,"notice a non binary option in the triad :  stabilization circuits, short-range runaway circuits,  and  long-range  runaway  circuits. Nick is the only philsopher aware of this modernist tendency toward fractalization and the only one who is not rejecting it but using it to his advantage.",,,,,
side-lining  exploratory  mutation  over against a homeostatic paradigm.20,,Yes. This is important.,"20. Plant and Land, ‘Cyberpositive’,  305;  Norbert  Weiner, Cy- bernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (New York: MIT Press, 1965); Land, ‘Circuitries’, 298.",,,,
The key difference lies in the impossibility of distilling the effects of long-range runaway circuitry in terms of metrics alone.,,,,,,,
" A cyberpositive  circuit  that can sustain itself  over  a long  period  of time—a  question of the capacity to self-design, ‘but only in such a way that the self is  perpetuated as  something redesigned’—will  reach  a state of feedback  density that effectively flips extensity into intensity, and thus engineers a change in kind rather than degree: phase  shift, or catastrophe (with -strophe derived from the Greek strephein, ‘to turn’).21",,"Or it could be more sophisticated than that but easier to state: to get rid of the kind/degree distinction and maintina that it is non metrically measurable, is to say that its feed back decision becomes non probabilistic. The decision metrics (inputs-outputs) could be digitally limited, but the decision for state transition and searching and sorting are computationally complex.","21. Land, ‘Circuitries’, 298. Speed  is important to cyberpositive dynamics, but only insofar as it effectuates a qualitative change (or better, is understood as an intensive quantity). This is a sig- nificant point, given prominent criticisms of (Landian) Acceler- ationism for its focus on ‘capitalist speed  alone’ and its ‘purely dromological’ character. The compressed loops that diagram cybernetic  intensity  immanentize  ‘self’  and  its redesign  on a vector of autonomous  productive  capacity  that is, by defini- tion, ungovernable  (cybernetically and politically)  by any tran- scendent or external program. What this ultimately describes is the collapse of the is/ought distinction that legitimates both human political agency and—coincidentally—the orthogonality thesis  in Artificial Intelligence research.  Without transcendent regulation of the is by the ought, the future  trajectory of this self-propelled  re-organizing  force  (capitalism;  artificial intelli- gence…assuming  one still wishes  to make that distinction)  is strictly unknowable in advance.  The two come together in an emergent becoming that is, as Yeats and Land both  grasp, in- dividuated not through  dialectics, but through  the  cybernetic spiral that constitutes modernity, esoterically apprehended. See Srnicek and Williams, ‘#Accelerate’,  and Srnicek and Williams, ‘Cunning Automata: Financial Acceleration at the  limits of the Dromological’ in R. Mackay (ed), Collapse, vol. VIII (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2014). See also, Land, ‘Machinic Desire’, 329.",,,,
"  It is here that the cybernetic propensity for ‘exploratory mutation’ finds its vocation as the producer of true novelty and, compressed into the notion of negentropy, dovetails with what Land refers to as ‘intelligence’, that which modernity—grasped nonlinearly—labours to eman- cipate.22 ",,,,,,,

"In the Judwalis’ sys- tem, Fate and Will occupy opposite poles of opposing cones and thereby increase and decrease in perfect inverse ratio to one another. Historically interpreted, Fate corresponds to the wide end of the ‘primary’ cone,  and is  thus set to exert maximum  influence over the imminent final phases  of the current Cycle as it veers closer to catastrophe.25 ",,"For the ancients the issue is being Fated to doom without capacity of will to overcome it. The modern predicament is not too different, with social, economic, political freedom programmed to doom, with only an accelerated program that can save individuals.","25. In the  system,  Fate is opposed  to Destiny, with the  latter ‘being understood to mean all external acts and forms created by the Will itself and out of itself, whereas  Fate is all those acts or forms imposed upon the Will from without’.

More and more: it is simply not for us.’ Meanwhile, ‘TROLL THREAD IS TROLL THREAD… TT does what it wants because  it doesn’t give a shit—it’s a site with no one at the  helm.’ Ibid.; ‘Occulted dimensionality, print cryogenizes,  but hypermedia melts things together, disontolo- gizing the person  through  schizotech-disassembly, disintegrat- ed convergence.’ Land, ‘Cybergothic’, 356.",,,,
"It begins to become apparent that change  is effected by the technology, with the human producer playing a secondary role— indicative of a gradual inversion of the cybernegative starting point.",,"This technological gadgetry is similar to the compass use of Tristain Garcia. Any binary gadget can then be said to create a set of states, if these states can be teleologically predicted from extrema to extrema",,,,,
"Indeed, the level of sophistication achieved by some of these projects has already created situations in which the line dividing human from inhuman production genuinely evades clear delineation.61",,"It no longer suffices past the first strata to claim that there is a conjunction of the human inhuman, without risking the same anglo folly or commitment to a cyborgian mythology. A necessary place holder perhaps for its own growth procedure, but one which remains bounded to its heritage.","61. Weird Sun Twitter, the  works of Carton  Trebe, and Oscar Schwartz and Benjamin Laird’s ‘Turing Test for Poetry’ are just a few examples. See note 59 above, and Bot or Not?:<http://botpoet.com/about/accessed17/01/2015>.",,,,
"The technical excruciation of writing documents the progressive,  incremental  migration  of  agency  outwards,  from  human  writers  to  their autonomous technological  tools  until  it  is  no longer  the author but ‘the process  that speaks—multiplicitously, and [initially] in secret, [spreading] across  an open, pub- licly-policed  space’.62 ",,,"62. N. Land, ‘Open Secret’, Outside In, <http://www.xenosystems.net/open-secret/>.",,,,
"Works devoid  of  characters, setting, imagery, linearity, and plot quietly proliferate in cyberspace, leaving a cold arrangement of signs that fail to transport one anywhere  save upriver in a much more real sense  than Conrad’s Kurtz’s met- aphorical journey ever did.",,,,,,,
It is the poememenon’s investment  in  form  over  content that testifies  to complicity  with  the spiral.,,,,,,,
"An accelerating  poetics that pushes  against the crumbling threshold of hu- man intelligibility,  edging  towards the realization  of Bataille’s  cyclonic  prophecy:  ‘what  matters is  not the enunciation of the wind, but the wind’.63",,,"63. Bataille, Œuvres Complètes, Vol. V, 25.",,,,
"As the producer  disappears  into  the machine,  the reader  is  confronted with  increasingly  vertiginous challenges  to traditional  methods of  textual  consumption.",,,,,,,
"Most alarmingly, the diminishment of human authorship  plunges  the human  reader  into  a problematics of scale. The sheer length and disconcerting complexity of combinatorial pieces, like the tedious  repetition  of copied  and  transcribed  texts (both modes of enacting non-narrative violence as",,,,,,,
a problematization of chronology/ROM) renders them  either  impossible  or  entirely  unpleasurable to consume  in  any ordinary  manner.64 ,,,"64. ‘Everything that has a subject should be detested; everything  that erases  its subject should be  loved…A  good  poem is very boring. A great poem  is more boring than  the  act of reading itself.’  T. Lin, ‘Ambient  Stylistics’,  in American Poetry: States of the  Art, Conjunctions 35 (Fall 2000).  To cite a few examples of such  texts:  Kenneth  Goldsmith, Day (Great Barrington: The Figures, 2003);  Craig Dworkin, Parse  (Berkeley: Atelos, 2008); Chris Sylvester, Total Walkthrough (Troll Thread: 2011); Chris  Sylvester.

"It  has  been argued,  particularly in the case of conceptual writing,that the textual demand for both linear and close reading be scrapped in favour of methods more akin to scanning, browsing, and ‘spritzing’.65",,,65. See <http://www.spritzinc.com/>.,,,,
"The frenetic, over-stimulated restlessness of such habits  escalates quickly  as  readers  become  users in an increasingly exploitative relationship with their tools of textual consumption.",,But what is being critiqued here other than a loss of some antiquated cliched humanism? Why not embrace the new performance of this art?,,,,,
"We, as users, are formatted by our platforms (just as they format data). ",,,,,,,
We are directed by our platforms insofar as “operation” also means “permitted operation” (an operation the platform permits or allows us). ,,,,,,,

"It denotes a state of affairs where the “operations”  process,  direct,  define,  figure both data and us. ",,,,,,,
In order for us to be users we have to be used. I am not saying this should be or could be avoided (it is only becoming more obvious that there  is  no escape). ,,,,,,,
"In  fact, I  welcome  the  debasement promised us by our little gadgets. But maybe I just enjoy being punished.66",,,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/05/troll-thread-interview/,,,,

 It is a lesson from the occulted primary process  that one submits to with supreme exhilaration.,,,,,,,
"Taken together as incremental steps in a fatal(istic) process,  this  double  elimination  constitutes  a harrowing prognosis for the human producer and the human consumer of writing alike—but one that is entirely  consonant  with  its  modernist  literary  inheritance if we do not hesitate to draw out the full implications  of an avant-gardism  that has  progressively dethroned the author, the linear narrative,the scaled plot, phenomenological interest, and all other accoutrements of human intelligibility by dint of an utterly  necessary experimentalism— ",,,,,,,

III. Hyperoccultation,,,,,,,
Affirming an occulted Outside from within is meaningless unless  affirmation  also  functions  as  invocation— and  all  good  demonologists  know that invocation  requires  a diagram.  ,,Program,,,,,
"As well  as  modelling cyberpositive modernity’s unfolding from the inside and  foreshadowing  its  fate from the outside, the spiral has a third, recursive function. It auto-invokes.",,AutoInvocation,,,,,
"Because  negentropy  engineers  its  own  temporality— an  ‘intensive  transition to a new numeracy’ marking ‘a  change in nature’ — anastrophic  modernism commands a nonlinear relationship between cause and effect, riding the convergent wave generated by its own assembly ‘back’ to the present to install the conditions that will have been necessary for its  emergence.67   ",,,"67.

"Encoding the cues for the future-it-arrives-from  into  the present-it-infiltrates requires  an  arsenal  of  occultural  tactics—robust conceptual  impregnation,  clandestine  memetic  direction, proliferation of carriers, calculated obfuscation, the implantation of cognitive primers,and so on.69  ",,,"69.

"The Human Security System seeks to repress anastrophic insurgency by enforcing chronology, but in doing so, inadvertently provides cover for its enemy. ",,,,,,,
"In this way, the future, operating under chronological camouflage, stealthily invokes the conditions required for its own truth.",,,,,,,
The real esoteric clue to acclerationism’s proficiency is  thus to recognize  that to diagram  is  not simply to describe  something  that is  already there. ,,,,,,,
"‘You ever see  her odd little essay  about “Ascryptions”?’ enquires  Calvin  Dodd—referring  to Mary Karno— of the unnamed  protagonist in  Land’s  short story, Deadlines.  ‘Never  met anyone  who gets it,’  Dodd continues,  ‘I  certainly  never  did, before.  Subtitled Practices for Writing on Reality, then wall-to-wall senselessness, even by her standards. [But] it’s all in the first two sentences. Writers get stuck when they forget that every  story has  a demon. To begin, you have to learn its name.’ ‘Ascryption?’ replies the unnamed interloctor. ‘Exactly,’ confirms Dodd.70",,,"70. N. Land, ‘Deadlines (Part-1)’, Outside In, <http://www.xenosystems.net/deadlines-part-1/>.   Karno’s   subtitle—‘Practices for Writing on Reality’—can be taken as literally as one likes.",,,,
"Ascryption can, perhaps,  be grasped  as ascription’s cryptic double. While the latter attributes effect to cause, the former, a species of hyperstitional revalencing, attributes  cause  to effect. ",,,,,,,

"Techonomics  is  a Google-strewn word  of  irresistible inevitability, repeatedly struggling to birth itself,  within  myriads  of  spelling  mints.  It  only remains to regularize  its  usage.

Something is summoning a demon through Land’s invention of its name. ,,,,,,,
Beyond the occulted primary process tracking judgement’s absorption into auto-production lies a hyperocculted  invocation  piloted  by the spiral.74,,"Fractalisation has always been Kantian, and the outsider head spinning haze of the bygone era rode ontop of its aesthetic fetish.","74. Such a statement too has its esoteric and exoteric content. An occultist  of the  right  spirit might  find a useful clue in the following passage, from Aleister Crowley’s Liber ABA: ‘If I strike a billiard-ball and it moves, both my Will and its motion are due to causes  long antecedent to the act. I may consider both my Work and its reaction  as twin effects of the  eternal Universe. The moved  arm and ball are parts  of a state of the  Cosmos which resulted necessarily from its momentarily previous state, and so, back for ever. Thus, my Magical Work is only one of the cause-effects necessarily concomitant with the cause-effects which set the ball in motion. I may therefore regard the act of striking as a cause-effect of my original Will to move the  ball, though necessarily previous to its motion. But the case of mag- ical Work is not quite analogous. For my nature is such that I am compelled to perform Magick in order to make my Will to pre- vail; so that the cause  of my doing the Work is also the cause of the  ball’s motion, and there  is no reason  why one should precede  the other.’ (San Francisco: Weiser Books, 1997), 192.",,,,
"Once  the demon  has  been  summoned,  ensuring its reality is nothing more difficult than a matter of propagative efficiency:",,The binary doom of fractal Kantianism,,,,,
"The successful  meme  is  characterized  by aesthetic  features  irreducible  to  representational adequacy, from  elegance of construction to dramatic form. Even more importantly, it is able to operate as a causal factor itself, and thus to produce the very effects it accommodates itself to. ",,,"75. N. Land, ‘Gyres’, Outside In, <http://www.xenosystems.net/gyres/>. ",,,,
A society enthralled by its passage  through the winter gate of a fourth turning would in very large  measure  be  staging  the same  theatrical production its ‘beliefs’ had anticipated.75,,,"And again: ‘As its prospect condenses, Technological Singularity is already operative as a cultural influence, and thus a causal factor in the social process.

The diagram  that lies  embedded  within  teleoplexy thus reasserts itself on a meta-level. ,,,,,,,

The cultural effectiveness of accelerationism as cyberpositivity is entirely cyberpositive: accelerationism invokes itself from the future.,,,,,,,
"The conclusion to be drawn from this is that hyperstition is the real truth of philosophy—if not the basic, horrific form of reality itself.",,"Or perhaps Hyperstition is the real form of philosophy, and the horrific truth of reality itself",,,,,
"Horrific, because  it means that this isn’t the first time it has happened  this way.",,,,,,,
"Land acts as an intensifier  for accelerationism’s  auto-realization, but claims  of agency  beyond  this  quickly  become murky as nonlinear models of origination are effectively papered-over by the enforced chronology of historical determination.",,,,,,,

"In  2012,  Dr Fiona  ‘Fi’  Xia,  a one- time student of MVU’s Linda Trent, published two papers  on a collection of occult artefacts that had recently  been  discovered  in  eastern Iraq.77   ",,,"77. Xia’s work is notoriously difficult to track down. To surmise that it has suffered  deliberate institutional suppression is to go too far in the direction conspiracy-theorizing, although the few scattered  remnants locatable  on  the web  certainly  testify  to strange  goings-on.

These included swatches of an impossibly well-preserved textile resembling ‘human skin’ and various items of crumbling esoterica that general consensus among archaeologists had attributed to the private library of the same Harun Al-Raschid appearing in the account given by Robartes as the sceptical caliph before whom Kusta ben Luka had his pupils dance out the diagrams  that would be  schematized—roughly eight centuries later—by Giraldus. ,,,,,,,
"In the first of these two papers,  Xia made the following claim: al- though it is incontestable that the bulk of the arte- facts had belonged to Harun Al-Raschid, several of the more enigmatic items, including the mysterious fabric and a set of encrypted codices bound in dark paper—one of which bore a cipher in the form of a spiral, but doubly twisted, so the spiral appeared to consume itself—had been personal possessions of ben Luka, and this particular volume was in fact the long lost text from which the Judwalis had extracted  their philosophical  system.78 ",,,"78.

"Information   concerning   the  program’s abrupt  cancellation   is   scarce,   although   sources close  to Xia  have  intimated  that it  had to do with the nature of the program’s findings. These  would later  become  the subject of a paper  given  at the Sixth  International  Congress   on  the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East (CCNESA) and form the basis  of  her  second  publication,  ‘The  Templexed Abomination of Terrestrial Modernity: Notes on the Spiral  Codex of the Court of Harun Al-Raschid’.79",,,"79.

"One  must be  cautious  of jumping  to conclusions; however,  a close reading of this second  paper sug- gests that Xia was well aware of the connection to Yeats’s  gyre system and  indeed  believed that she had uncovered  its  true source.",,,,,,,
"As if  conspiring  to compound the enigmatic quality of her findings, the CCNESA has since removed  all trace of Xia’s work from its records.80",,,"80.  Outside  of certain  strands  of personal  communication  it

"Fragmented  documentation  retrieved  from  an  archaeology message board between March and April of 2013 further corroborates this interpretation. Not long  after efforts focused  on  breaking  the text’s code had begun to bear fruit, it seems that Xia had called the team together to read the codex’s opening lines for what she assumed would be the first time in the modern world, only to be forced to immediately revise this assumption.
